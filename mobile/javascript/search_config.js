The medical science and           clinical world is seeing concepts like Personalized Medicine , Precision Medicine and Regenerative Medicine           rapidly becoming reality. DiponEd Institute of Regenerative Medicine (DIRM), is committed to update the           knowledge of the busy practitioners through a mix of compact accessible education program using virtual           online and AR VR like platforms plus on-site lab and clinical trainings. DIRM also aims at creating basic medical            and scientiﬁc level awareness, and skill development on latest Personalized health care technologies and             treatments through its Participatory Medicine program. Our education program is aimed at advancing health-             care and medical sciences, while integrating latest knowledge from genetics, cellular biology, 3D printing,           tissue engineering, proteomics, metabolomics, stem cell transplants, cancer immunotherapies, neoantigens,           pharmacogenomics etc.                                         At  DIRM  https://www.diponed.com/dirm/  we  oﬀer  National  \&  International                                      University aﬃliated courses in Regenerative medicine and Personalized medicine                                      to qualiﬁed surgeons / physicians. It has a very informative coverage on basics of                                      transfusion and transplantation of human stem cells and other subject areas                                      required for developing and running smart health care and personalized medi-                                      cine, clinics.             The  institute  is  also  oﬀering  skill  development  in  Paramedical,  Nursing,  Medical  lab  technology,  Clinical            Research, IVF and laboratory QA/ QC, Diagnostics lab services etc. DIRM is the beginning of our journey in            social health care awareness and medical education,and we aim at transforming it into a modern medical            About Translational and Regen           erative Medicine                  Regenerative Medicine is one of the newest and most powerful approaches in biomedical science; it oﬀers           the opportunity to experimentally approach previously intractable biological questions and develop cell -           based therapeutics. Its represents the evolution of new treatment options of many unmet medical conditions           and illnesses through tissue repair and replacement. The use of various adult cells, and stem cells harvested           from the patients themselves are demonstrating extremely promising results in clinical trials and other           studies. Referred to as stem-cell therapies, or just cellular therapies, they involve taking stem cells from the           body, culturing them, isolating them and putting them back into the body to induce tissue to regrow. Many           years of hard work and research are bearing fruit as clinical trials progress according to schedule globally. We           can be optimistic that novel therapies will soon make currently untreatable diseases and disorders treatable.           It is important for clinicians to remain updated on the latest developments in the ﬁeld of 3D printing, tissue           engineering, cellular transplants, their clinical implications and gear up as the next generation health care           providers.             Clinical Areas or Regenerative Medicine Practice                                 Researchers hope stem cells will one day be eﬀective in the treatment of several medical                             conditions and diseases. But unproven stem cell treatments can be unsafe—so doctors and                             patients  must get all of the facts before considering oﬀering any treatment. Stem cells                             have been called everything from cure-alls to miracle treatments. DIRM oﬀers to clear the                             hype through clinical and scientiﬁc updates and educating the stake holders of this ﬁeld.                             Regenerative medicine has the potential to heal tissues and organs damaged by age,                             disease, or trauma, congenital defects etc. Recent preclinical and clinical data supports                             the possibility for treating both chronic diseases and acute insults, and abet maladies                             occurring across a wide array of indications in blood related diseases and disorders,           including non-healing dermal wounds, diabetes, auto-immune conditions, infectious diseases,  pulmonary           diseases, male –, female- infertility, neuro- , ortho- , cartilage-  degenerative conditions, cardiovascular           diseases and traumas, treatments for certain types of cancer, and many more. The current therapy of trans-           plantation of intact organs and tissues to treat organ and tissue failures and loss suﬀers from limited donor           supply and often severe immune complications, but these obstacles may potentially be bypassed through the           use of regenerative medicine strategies.                                                                                                                      2","DiponEd Ins�tute of Regenera�ve Medicine (DIRM)              Regenerative Medicine FDA - approved products                Category               Name           Biological Agent                Approved use              Biologics              laViv          Autologous  broblasts           Improving nasolabial fold appearance                                  Carticel       Autologous chondrocytes         Cartilage defects from acute or                                                                                  repetitive trauma                                     Apligraf       Allogeneic cultured keratinocytes Topical mucogingival conditions, leg                                  GINTUIT         and  broblasts in bovine  collagen and diabetic foot ulcers                                   Cord blood     Hematopoietic stem and          Hematopoietic and immunological                                                 progenitor cells                reconstitution after myeloablative                                                                                  treatment           Cell-based medical     Dermagraft     Allogeneic  broblasts           Diabetic foot ulcers            devices                Celution       Cell extraction                 Transfer of autologous adipose stem                                                                                 cells              Biopharmaceuticals     GEM 125        PDGF-BB, tricalcium phosphate   Periodontal defects                                   Regranex       PDGF-BB                         Lower extremity diabetic ulcers                                  Infuse, Infuse  BMP-2                          Tibia fracture and nonunion, and lower                                   bone graft,                                    spine fusion                                  Inductors                                   Osteogenic     BMP-7                           Tibia nonunion                                  protein-1                                                                       The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR),                                                              approves the use of minimally manipulated stem                                                              cells and hematopoietic stem cells in Blood Related                                                              diseases and disorders.
